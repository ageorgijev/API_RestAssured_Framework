# API_RestAssured_Framework
This is a simple Rest Assured framework for testing endpoints.
After the project is cloned find AuthAPITest class and click on Run 'AuthAPITest' from the class level. All classes will be run in priority order.
Test also can be run using "mvn test" from the terminal. Running tests from the testng.xml file doesn't work for some reason
Method deleteData() will be run at the end and data will be deleted to have a clear start point for the next run of tests.
